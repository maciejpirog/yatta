# YATTA: Yet Another Tool for Text Analysis

A toy bootstrapped generator of recursive descent parsers.

This is an extraordinarily ancient project (AD 2006), completed as a part of the OO-programming course when I was a first-year student - please keep your expectations low!

YATTA is heavily inspired by [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/), the only parser generator I knew at the time. The name comes - of course! - from [Green Leaves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pr-WUa8eEs).

## What is it?

YATTA is a **parser generator**, which means that it is a program that reads a definition of a context-free grammar and produces a piece of C++ code that is able to parse expressions accordingly. It is **bootstrapped**, that is, the parser used by YATTA to read grammar definitions has been generated by YATTA itself. 

## Example input

The description of a grammar of simple arithmetic expresisons is as follows. I think it is sufficiently self-explanatory. The file extension is `.yg` for "yatta grammar".

```
LEXER:
priv digit ('0'..'9');
skip whitespace ('q' | '\t');
token number (digit)(digit)*;
token add ('+' | '-');
token mult ('*' | '/');
token lp ('(');
token rp (')');

PARSER:
rule main (add_expr ENDOFFILE);
rule add_expr (mult_expr)(add mult_expr)*;
rule mult_expr (base_expr)(mult base_expr)*;
rule base_expr (!lp add_expr !rp) | (^number);
```
